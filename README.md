# Singularity Deb Builder

This repo/ci setup is designed to build a deb package for singularity by downloading the rpm and converting it to a deb.

The motivation for this is that singularity is out of date in all deb repos

If you would like to verify what this package will do when you install/uninstall it, please look at the files that are generated to validate the build (txt files showing diffs after install and uninstall)
